Technologies used: 
    - React frontend/Rails backend

Approach taken:
    - I rewatched the class recordings for the first two days of the lesson in order to determine what I needed to do to meet the assignment requirments. 

Unsolved problems, and notes to yourself/group members so you can come back to your project later and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc:
    -No problems, but I would like to revisit app in the future and add pictures of these purses, as well as add articles that talk about these purses in depth, such as why they're so expensive in the first place and how to take care of them.
